# Deep Learning Lab Assignments

This repository contains five lab assignments completed as part of the **Deep Learning** course at our university. Each lab focuses on a fundamental concept or technique in deep learning, implemented and tested using Python.

## Contents

1. **Logistic Regression**  
   Implementation of logistic regression for binary classification tasks. Demonstrates the use of the sigmoid function, decision boundaries, and model evaluation.

2. **Gradient Descent**  
   A hands-on exercise to understand and visualize how gradient descent works in optimizing cost functions. Includes implementation from scratch.

3. **Loss and Cost Function**  
   Exploration of various loss and cost functions used in training deep learning models. Includes derivations, plots, and code examples for MSE, cross-entropy, etc.

4. **Regularization**  
   Introduction to L1 and L2 regularization techniques. Shows how they help in reducing overfitting and improving generalization in models.

5. **Potato Leaf Disease Detection using CNN**  
   A mini-project involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying healthy and diseased potato leaves. Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
